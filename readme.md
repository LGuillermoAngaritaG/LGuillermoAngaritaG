# Hello!

My name is Guillermo and I am a Data Scientist, I love explaining data with Statistics, Artificial Intelligence Models, and Visualization Tools. I have worked on analyzing hundreds of Data-sets comprising billions of registries in a wide variety of topics from Social-networks, Real-estate, Video games, and E-commerce businesses to Academic papers and Experimental data obtained in research. Right now I’m a Ph.D. candidate (I finished my research and I’m waiting for my dissertation) with expected graduation in March 2021. 

My Ph.D. research was based on new methods of characterization for hydrodynamic phenomena in Pumps working as Turbines using CFD simulations, Artificial Intelligence, and Experimental Techniques. I believe that there is always something that can be done better in an organization and my skills allow me to find just that. My biggest interest is applying artificial intelligence tools to predict the behavior of data and to produce tools that can be used in improving processes. 

Below you can see the projects I have worked on. The majority are private Repositories because they are part of products that can be purchased, or are being published in a research paper. I'm actively working on making a website where my projects will have a description of the code that I have employed and show my results. If you want to know more about my work please contact me.

## Data Mining

These projects are about data extraction from websites or APIs, using popular Python libraries such as Scrapy, Selenium, Beautiful Soup or Requests.
